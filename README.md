# 📱 Mobile Development & IoT

Welcome to the **Mobile Development & IoT** course! This repository contains notes, exercises, and projects related to mobile development using **React Native** and **Expo Go**, integrating IoT concepts and modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices.

## 🚀 Course Overview
This course focuses on **cross-platform mobile app development** with **React Native**, using **Expo Go** for simplified testing. We will also explore **IoT device integration** and best practices for performance and scalability.

## 📌 Topics Covered
**1️⃣ JavaScript Fundamentals**
* Variables: `let`, `const`, `var`
* Data types: strings, numbers, arrays, objects
* Control structures: if/else, switch, loops
* Functions: regular and arrow functions
* Asynchronous programming: callbacks, promises, async/await
  
**2️⃣ React Native & Expo Go**
* **React Native**: Building cross-platform mobile apps
* **Expo Go**: Simplified development and testing
* **Component-based UI**: JSX, functional components, styling with `StyleSheet`
  
**3️⃣ APIs & IoT Integration**
* API consumption with Fetch
* Data manipulation: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
* IoT integration: connecting with sensors and smart devices
  
**4️⃣ TypeScript Introduction**
* JavaScript vs TypeScript
* Static typing and interfaces
